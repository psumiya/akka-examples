Simple Examples for Akka

This repository started from the [Lightbend's Akka Quickstart](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-scala) example.

I have found the content and examples on Akka's site to require several re-readings to grasp a concept. The goal for this repository 
is to provide an alternative approach to get introduced to actors.

You are welcome to add examples if you think it is consistent with the bite-sized approach used in other examples.
