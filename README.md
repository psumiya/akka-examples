## Simple Examples for Akka

This repository started from the [Lightbend's Akka Quickstart](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-scala) example.

I have found the content and examples on Akka's site to require several re-readings to grasp a concept. The goal for this repository 
is to provide an alternative approach to get introduced to actors.

## How to navigate the examples?
The examples are packaged in increasing order of complexity based on the package names, thus com.example.zero is the starting point, i.e. most simple.

## How can I contribute?
You are welcome to add examples via a Pull Request if you think it is consistent with the bite-sized approach used in other examples.

You can also provide suggestions on examples needed for what you see is difficult on the Akka documentation that would benefit the community at large.
